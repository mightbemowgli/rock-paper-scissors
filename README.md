# The updated Rock Paper Scissors assignment for The Odin Project

This exercise helped me get familiarized with event listeners and  
modifying the DOM. It was fun to go back to some older code that  
I had written and try to find some ways to improve it with what I've  
learned in the time that's passed.

Here is a [working preview](https://mightbemowgli.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/).
